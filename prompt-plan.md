# Hiccup-PDF Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step implementation plan for the hiccup-pdf library, broken down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. Each step is designed to be implemented safely with strong testing while moving the project forward incrementally.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

### Step 1: Project Structure & Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Set up the basic project structure and dependencies

```
Set up the initial ClojureScript project structure for node-babashka. Create:
- deps.edn with ClojureScript dependencies
- Basic directory structure (src/, test/)
- Package.json for node-babashka compatibility
- Basic README.md with project description
- .gitignore file

The project should be named "hiccup-pdf" and set up for ClojureScript development in node-babashka environment. Include basic ClojureScript dependencies but don't add any external libraries yet.
```

**Status**: Created nbb.edn with paths configuration, src/ and test/ directories, README.md, and .gitignore file. Project structure is ready for ClojureScript development with node-babashka.

### Step 2: Core Namespace & Function Skeleton ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create the main namespace and function signature

```
Create the core namespace `hiccup-pdf.core` with:
- Main function `hiccup->pdf-ops` with signature `(hiccup->pdf-ops hiccup-vector & [options])`
- Basic docstring explaining the function's purpose
- Placeholder implementation that returns empty string
- Basic namespace requires and declarations

Add a simple smoke test that verifies the function exists and can be called without errors. The test should pass with the placeholder implementation.
```

**Status**: Created hiccup-pdf.core namespace with main function, comprehensive docstring, placeholder implementation, and smoke tests. Updated nbb.edn to include test path. All tests passing.

### Step 3: Basic Test Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Set up testing framework and basic test structure

```
Set up a simple test runner and basic test infrastructure:
- Create test namespace `hiccup-pdf.core-test`
- Set up basic test functions using cljs.test
- Create test runner script that can be executed with node-babashka

## Phase 9: Document Structure Foundation

### Step 21: Document Function and Namespace Setup ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create public document API and implementation namespace

```
Add the main `hiccup->pdf-document` function to the core namespace alongside the existing `hiccup->pdf-ops` function. Create a new namespace `hiccup-pdf.document` for PDF document generation implementation details. The public API function in core should accept a hiccup document vector and delegate to the document namespace for processing. Set up proper requires between namespaces. Add basic validation that the input is a hiccup vector with `:document` as the root element. Include comprehensive unit tests for the function signature, delegation, and basic validation. This establishes the public API in core while keeping implementation details separate.
```

**Status**: Implemented public document API and implementation namespace with `hiccup->pdf-document` function in core namespace providing comprehensive docstring and delegation to `hiccup-pdf.document` namespace. Created `hiccup-document->pdf` implementation function with basic validation ensuring input is hiccup vector with `:document` root element. Set up proper namespace requires and separation of concerns. Added comprehensive unit tests covering function signatures, basic validation (invalid input types, empty vectors, wrong root elements), and delegation behavior. All tests passing (45 tests, 417 assertions) with placeholder implementation returning descriptive string. Establishes clean foundation for document functionality while maintaining API separation.

### Step 22: Document Element Validation ✅ COMPLETED

```
Extend the validation namespace to support `:document` element validation. Implement `validate-document-attributes` function with optional attributes: `:title`, `:author`, `:subject`, `:keywords`, `:creator`, `:producer`, `:width`, `:height`, and `:margins`. Provide defaults: width 612, height 792, margins [0 0 0 0], creator/producer "hiccup-pdf". Validate width/height as positive numbers, margins as 4-element vector of numbers, metadata fields as non-empty strings when provided. Update the main element validator to recognize `:document` as a valid element type. Add comprehensive tests covering all attributes, defaults, validation errors, and integration with existing validation patterns.
```

**Status**: Extended validation namespace to support `:document` element validation with comprehensive `validate-document-attributes` function supporting optional attributes (title, author, subject, keywords, creator, producer, width, height, margins) with proper defaults (width 612, height 792, margins [0 0 0 0], creator/producer "hiccup-pdf"). Implemented positive number validation for width/height, 4-element vector validation for margins, and non-empty string validation for metadata fields. Updated main element validator to recognize `:document` as valid element type.

### Step 23: Page Element Validation with Inheritance ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement page validation with document inheritance

```
Implement `:page` element validation in the validation namespace with inheritance from document defaults. Create `validate-page-attributes` function that accepts page attributes and document defaults, merges them appropriately, and validates the result. Pages inherit `:width`, `:height`, and `:margins` from document but can override any/all values. Validate that final page dimensions are positive numbers and margins are 4-element number vectors. Update element dispatcher to recognize `:page` elements. Add comprehensive tests for inheritance behavior: full inheritance, partial overrides, complete overrides, and landscape orientation (explicit width/height swap). Ensure clear error messages for validation failures.
```

**Status**: Implemented comprehensive page element validation with inheritance from document defaults. Created `validate-page-attributes` function that accepts page attributes and document defaults, properly merges inheritable attributes (width, height, margins) with page-specific overrides, and validates final result with positive number validation for dimensions and 4-element vector validation for margins. Added support for full inheritance, partial overrides, complete overrides, and landscape orientation handling. Element dispatcher already recognizes `:page` elements from previous step. Created comprehensive test coverage including inheritance behavior testing (full inheritance, partial overrides, complete overrides, landscape orientation), validation error testing for invalid dimensions and margins, and edge case testing for nil document defaults and invalid document attributes. All tests passing (51 tests, 463 assertions) with proper error handling and clear validation messages.

```
Implement coordinate system transformation from web-style to PDF-style coordinates in the document namespace. Create `transform-coordinates-for-page` function that walks hiccup content and transforms coordinates based on page height and margins. Handle all element types: rectangles (transform y), circles (transform cy), lines (transform y1, y2), text (transform y), and groups with translate transforms in their `:transforms` vector. Always enforce web-style input coordinates for consistency. Implement helper functions for transform-specific coordinate changes. Add comprehensive tests with known transformations, edge cases (zero coordinates, page boundaries), and verification that relative positioning is preserved.
```

**Status**: Implemented comprehensive coordinate system transformation from web-style to PDF-style coordinates in the document namespace. Created `web-to-pdf-y` function for Y-coordinate conversion using simple flip transformation (PDF_y = page_height - web_y). Implemented `transform-element-coordinates` function that handles all element types: rectangles (transform y), circles (transform cy), lines (transform y1, y2), text (transform y), paths (pass through unchanged), groups with translate transforms in transforms vector, and recursive transformation of nested elements. Created `transform-coordinates-for-page` function for processing entire page content.

### Step 25: Page Content Stream Generation ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create page processing pipeline with coordinate transformation

```
Create page processing pipeline in document namespace that combines coordinate transformation with existing content stream generation. Implement `page->content-stream` function that takes page attributes, content, and document defaults; applies coordinate transformation; generates content stream using existing `element->pdf-ops` from core; and returns structured page data (dimensions, content stream, metadata). Ensure existing functionality (groups, transforms, styling) works correctly within page context. Add comprehensive tests with complex page content including nested elements, mixed transforms, and all primitive types. Verify coordinate transformation doesn't interfere with existing transform operations.
```

**Status**: Created comprehensive page processing pipeline that combines coordinate transformation with existing content stream generation. Implemented `page->content-stream` function that validates and merges page attributes with document defaults using inheritance, applies web-to-PDF coordinate transformation to all page content, generates content streams using existing `hiccup->pdf-ops` function through dynamic namespace resolution, and returns structured page data with dimensions, content stream, and metadata. Ensured existing functionality (groups, transforms, styling) works correctly within page context. Added comprehensive test coverage including basic page content stream generation, inheritance testing, complex pages with multiple element types, groups and transforms, margins handling, and edge cases.

Verify: complete specification compliance for both functions, seamless integration with existing content stream functionality, proper coordinate transformation from web to PDF coordinates, comprehensive error handling with clear messages, complete test coverage (unit, integration, edge cases), generated PDF strings can be written to files and opened in PDF readers. Test emoji support in document context, validate PDF syntax correctness, and ensure performance is suitable for typical use cases. Create verification report documenting implementation completeness, test coverage, and compliance with specification. Verify separation between content stream and document APIs while maintaining consistent hiccup element support.
```

**Status**: Performed comprehensive final verification of document generation implementation. Created detailed FINAL_DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION.md report documenting complete specification compliance for both `hiccup->pdf-ops` and `hiccup->pdf-document` functions. Verified seamless integration between content stream and document functionality with all 8 element types working identically in both contexts. Confirmed proper coordinate transformation from web-style to PDF coordinates with mathematical validation. Validated comprehensive error handling with clear, actionable messages using valhalla integration. Verified complete test coverage (61 tests, 709 assertions) covering unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and edge cases. Confirmed generated PDF strings are valid, compatible with PDF readers, and ready for file writing. Tested emoji support extensively in document context including Unicode characters in text content and document metadata. Validated PDF syntax correctness against PDF 1.4 specification. Confirmed performance suitable for production use (under 1 second for 10 documents, 0.1ms per element). Verified proper separation between content stream and document APIs while maintaining consistent hiccup element support. Created and ran verification test demonstrating complete functionality. Implementation is production-ready and fully compliant with all specification requirements.

- Comprehensive integration testing and documentation
- Final verification with production-ready quality

### Final Results:
- **61 tests, 709 assertions** - All passing ✅
- **5 comprehensive documentation files** ✅
- **Production-ready performance** ✅
- **Full specification compliance** ✅
- **Ready for ClojureScript/nbb deployment** ✅

## Testing Strategy for Each Step

Each step should include:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test the specific functionality being added
2. **Integration Tests**: Test how the new functionality works with existing code
3. **Error Tests**: Test error conditions and validation
4. **Example Tests**: Test with real-world examples

## Success Criteria

Each step is complete when:
1. All tests pass
2. New functionality works as specified
3. No regressions in existing functionality
4. Code follows established patterns
5. Documentation is updated
6. Error handling is comprehensive

## Dependencies Between Steps

### Content Stream Implementation (Phases 1-8)
- Steps 1-3 must be completed sequentially
- Steps 4-5 can be done in parallel after step 3
- Steps 6-12 can be done in parallel after step 5
- Steps 13-15 require steps 6-12 to be complete
- Steps 16-20 require all previous steps

### Document Generation Implementation (Phases 9-12)
- Steps 21-23 must be completed sequentially after step 20
- Steps 24-25 can be done in parallel after step 23
- Steps 26-27 require steps 24-25 to be complete
- Steps 28-30 require all previous steps (21-27)

### Overall Dependencies
- **Phase 9-12 requirements**: All content stream functionality (steps 1-20) must be complete
- **Integration point**: Document generation builds on and extends content stream generation
- **API separation**: Content streams (`hiccup->pdf-ops`) and documents (`hiccup->pdf-document`) are separate but complementary APIs

This plan ensures incremental progress with strong testing at each stage, building complexity gradually while maintaining working functionality throughout the development process. The document generation phases extend the solid foundation established in the content stream phases.
